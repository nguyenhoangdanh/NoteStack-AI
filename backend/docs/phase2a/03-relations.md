## üîß Relationship Detection Methods

### 1. Semantic Similarity
- **Method**: Vector embeddings with cosine similarity
- **Threshold**: ‚â• 0.75 relevance score
- **Boost Factor**: 1.2x (semantic relationships are prioritized)
- **Features**:
  - AI-powered content understanding
  - Language-agnostic concept matching
  - Context-aware similarity scoring

### 2. Contextual Relationships
- **Tag Similarity**: Shared tags increase relevance
- **Workspace Proximity**: Same workspace adds 0.2 relevance
- **Keyword Matching**: Porter stemming + Jaccard similarity
- **Threshold**: ‚â• 0.3 base relevance required

### 3. Temporal Relationships
- **Time Window**: ¬±7 days from target note creation
- **Decay Function**: Linear decay over time window
- **Weight**: 0.6x multiplier (lower priority)
- **Use Case**: Related research sessions, project phases

### 4. Reference Relationships
- **Key Phrase Extraction**: Important terms from note titles
- **Content Scanning**: Direct references to extracted phrases
- **Relevance**: Based on phrase match percentage
- **Weight**: 0.8x multiplier for direct references

## üöÄ Background Processing

### Queue System
- **Queue Name**: `related-notes`
- **Default Options**: 2 attempts, exponential backoff
- **Job Types**: 
  - `analyze-relations`: Single note analysis
  - `batch-relation-analysis`: Multiple notes processing
  - `update-relation-scores`: Recalculate existing relations
  - `cleanup-weak-relations`: Remove low-confidence relations
  - `rebuild-semantic-relations`: Refresh semantic embeddings

### Job Processing
```typescript
// Example job data structures
{
  "analyze-relations": {
    "noteId": "cm4note123",
    "userId": "cm4user456",
    "analysisType": "full", // or "semantic", "contextual", "temporal"
    "maxRelations": 10
  },
  "batch-relation-analysis": {
    "userId": "cm4user456", 
    "noteIds": ["cm4note1", "cm4note2", "..."],
    "analysisType": "full"
  },
  "cleanup-weak-relations": {
    "userId": "cm4user456",
    "minRelevance": 0.3,
    "olderThanDays": 30
  }
}
```

## üß™ Testing Examples

### Manual Testing with cURL

**Find related notes:**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/relations/notes/cm4note123/related?limit=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

**Save manual relation:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/relations/notes/cm4note123/save-relation \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "targetNoteId": "cm4note456",
    "relevance": 0.85,
    "type": "CONTEXTUAL"
  }'
```

**Queue analysis:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/relations/notes/cm4note123/analyze \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

**Get relationship graph:**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/relations/notes/cm4note123/graph?depth=2" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## üéØ Advanced Features

### Intelligent Scoring Algorithm
```typescript
const scoringFactors = {
  exactKeywordMatch: 0.4,    // Direct keyword matches
  semanticSimilarity: 0.3,   // AI embeddings similarity  
  titleMatch: 0.2,           // Title keyword overlap
  userHistory: 0.1           // Based on user interaction patterns
};

// Combined relevance calculation
const finalScore = Object.values(scoringFactors).reduce((sum, weight, index) => {
  return sum + (factorScores[index] * weight);
}, 0);
```

### Adaptive Learning
- **User Feedback**: Manual relations improve future suggestions
- **Usage Patterns**: Frequently accessed relations get higher priority
- **Content Evolution**: Relation scores update when notes are modified
- **Decay System**: Old, unused relations gradually lose relevance

### Performance Optimizations
- **Caching Strategy**: Store computed relations for fast retrieval
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple notes efficiently
- **Index Optimization**: Database indexes on relation fields
- **Progressive Loading**: Load relation data incrementally

## ‚ùå Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Poor relation quality"
**Cause:** Insufficient content or very short notes
**Solution:** Increase minimum content length threshold, combine with user tagging

### Issue: "Too many weak relations"
**Cause:** Low relevance threshold
**Solution:** Raise minimum relevance score, implement periodic cleanup

### Issue: "Missing obvious connections"
**Cause:** Different writing styles or terminology
**Solution:** Enable fuzzy matching, expand keyword synonym dictionary

### Issue: "Performance slow with many notes"
**Cause:** Real-time analysis of large note collection
**Solution:** Use background processing, implement result caching

## üìà Analytics and Insights

### Relationship Metrics
- **Connection Density**: Average relations per note
- **Strongest Clusters**: Highly interconnected note groups
- **Isolated Notes**: Notes with few or no relations
- **Relation Quality**: Distribution of relevance scores

### User Behavior Analysis
- **Most Connected Topics**: Notes with highest relation counts
- **Exploration Patterns**: How users navigate between related notes
- **Manual vs Auto Relations**: User preference for relationship types
- **Time-based Trends**: Relationship creation over time
